# 2 - Statistical Analysis
This folder contains scripts used for the statistical analysis of microbiome data, structured into four main areas:


## ⚙️ Structure

| Script                         | Description                                                                                                      |
|:-----------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `1_alpha_beta_diversity.R`    | Calculates **alpha diversity** using Shannon and Chao1 indices, and **beta diversity** using Aitchison distance. Statistical comparisons between groups are performed with **PERMANOVA**. |
| `2_differential_abundance_ANCOMBC.R` | Performs differential abundance analysis using **ANCOM-BC**, which adjusts for compositional effects and controls false discovery rate. |
| `3_differential_abundance_LINDA.R`   | Executes differential abundance testing with **LINDA**, a linear model-based approach suitable for zero-inflated compositional data. |
| `4_lasso_predictive_model.R`  | Builds **LASSO regression** models using the `glmnet` package to identify predictive microbial features. Evaluates model performance with **AUC** metrics. |
| `5_functional_analysis_humann.R` | Processes functional profiles generated by **HUMAnN3**, normalizes them to **copies per million (CPM)**, and stratifies by taxonomy. Prepares tables for downstream comparisons of functional potential across conditions. |
