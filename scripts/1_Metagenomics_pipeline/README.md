# Shotgun Metagenomic Preprocessing Pipeline (Parallelized)

This repository contains a pipeline for **preprocessing shotgun metagenomic samples**, from **raw sequencing data to non-normalized abundance tables**.

The workflow is designed to be **parallelized**, allowing multiple samples to be processed simultaneously across multiple steps. Scripts are optimized for execution in HPC environments using SLURM or SGE scheduling systems.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Shotgun data is large and computationally intensive. Processing many samples at once (e.g., 15) may cause system overload. Please consult your system administrator before running this pipeline at scale. Last tested on Logos cluster.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Parallel execution** – Samples are processed in parallel across all steps to reduce runtime.
- **Modular structure** – Split into five main steps, each handled by a dedicated script.
- **Intermediate file management** – Temporary files are generated and stored in a structured way to facilitate clean-up.
- **Final outputs** – Include merged abundance tables and QC reports.

## 🧪 Script Header Configuration

Each script is parallelizable via its **SGE/SLURM headers**. These must be modified according to your cluster settings.

**Example (SGE header):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash              # Shell to use
#$ -cwd                  # Run in current working directory
#$ -S /bin/bash          # Command shell
#$ -pe smp 5             # Number of CPUs
#$ -l mf=20G             # Requested memory
#$ -N 1_hr               # Job name
#$ -e log_1_hr           # Error log file
#$ -o log_1_hr           # Output log file
#$ -t 1-46               # Task array: number of samples
#$ -tc 15                # Max simultaneous tasks
```


## 🚀 How to Run the Pipeline

Step-by-step:
1 Copy Required Files to Project Directory:
  - combine_mpa.py
  - kreport2mpa.py
  - parallelized/scripts/
  - parallelized/options.txt
2 Configure:
  - Edit options.txt as needed (input/output paths, parameters).
  - Modify the header of each script to fit your cluster environment.
3 Execute Scripts:
  - Submit each script in sequence via:

```bash
Copiar
Editar
qsub 1_human_remove.qsub
qsub 2_QC_before.qsub
qsub 3_dedup_trim.qsub
qsub 4_QC_after.qsub
qsub 5.1_kraken.qsub
qsub 5.2_braken.qsub
qsub 5.3_krakentools2.qsub

```
4 Output Folders:
  - temp/ – Contains intermediate files organized by step (including QC reports).
  - out/ – Final output (merged abundance tables).
  - log_* – Log files for debugging and traceability.

5 Review QC Results.
6 Clean Up Temporary Files (Optional):
  ⚠️ This will delete most files in the temp/ folder, keeping only final QC reports:

```bash
Copiar
Editar
qsub delete_temp.qsub
```

## 📌 Notes
Scripts are intended for experienced users familiar with HPC environments.
Modify memory and CPU settings based on sample size and available resources.
File naming and directory structures must be respected for the pipeline to function correctly.
